Then, you will have strong data Sumo.\n\nSubsetting and manipulating data is probably the commonest activity for anyone who works with data. This is a core activity for exploratory data analysis, but is also extensively used in simple data acquisition, analysis and graphing, while also being related to more general data manipulating activities, for example database queries. This page is an introduction to the core syntax and some of the tools for manipulating and subsetting data in R.\n\n\n1.1 Objectives\n\nIndexing concept\nUsing which() and subsetting\nSelection on data.frame objects\nUsing aggregate()\nPractice exercises"

    "section": "2 Indexing concept",
    "text": "2 Indexing concept\n\nIf you would like to slice and dice your data, you will need to learn all about indexing!\n\nThe basics of the indexing concept in R syntax is very simple, where data storage objects like vectors (1 dimension), matrices (2 dimensions) and arrays (3 or more dimensions) store individual data values that can be accessed by the “address” of the dimension(s).\n\n\n2.1 How indexing works\nSay you have a numeric vector called my_vector that has 10 values. The index values will be 1 to 10, with each value corresponding consecutively to the data value at that position.\nmy_vector <- c(11.3, 11.2, 10.4, 10.4, 8.7, \n               10.8, 10.5, 10.3, 9.7, 11.2)\n  \nmy_vector\n[1] 11.3 11.2 10.4 10.4 8.7 10.8 10.5 10.3  9.7 11.2\n\nNotice the [1] in the R console output? This indicates the index of value right next to it and the R system will provide an index value for longer vectors as the wrap in the console. If we could see the actual index values it would look something like this:\n> my_vector\n [1] 11.3 11.2 10.4 10.4  8.7 10.8 10.5 10.3  9.7 11.2\n#     ^    ^    ^    ^    ^    ^    ^    ^    ^    ^\n#     1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10\n\n\n\n2.2 Vectors\nYou can create vector subsets by manipulating the index. Vector objects have indices in 1 dimension. For example, my_vector[1:i], where i is the length of the vector.\n## Vectors ####\n# Try this\n\nmy_vector <- c(11.3, 11.2, 10.4, 10.4, \n               8.7, 10.8, 10.5, 10.3, 9.7, 11.2)\n\n# Return all values\nmy_vector        # Typical way\nmy_vector[ ]     # Blank index implies all index values\nmy_vector[ 1:10] # Returns all index values explicitly\n\n# Return the first 3 values\n1:3 # Reminder of the function of the colon operator \":\"\nmy_vector[ 1:3] # Notice consecutive indices can use the \":\" operator\n\n# Return 5th and 9th values\nmy_vector[ c(5, 9)] # Notice we have to place non-consecutive index values in the c() function\n\n\n\n2.3 Matrices\nMatrix objects have 2 dimensions denoted as my_matrix[1:i, 1:j], where i is the number of rows and j is the number of columns.\n## Matrices ####\n# Try this\n\nmy_matrix <- matrix(data = c(2,3,4,5,6,6,6,6),\n                    nrow = 2, byrow = T)\n\nmy_matrix # notice how the arguments arranged the data\n\n# Flash challenge: make a matrix with the same data vector above to look like...\n#      [,1] [,2]\n# [1,]    2    6\n# [2,]    3    6\n# [3,]    4    6\n# [4,]    5    6\n\n# \"Slicing\" out a row or column\nmy_matrix[1,  ] # Slice out row 1\nmy_matric[ , 3] # Slice out column 3\n\n# Matrix columns and rows often have names\nnames(my_matrix) # No names yet\n\nnrow(my_matrix) # Returns number of rows (useful for large matrices)\nrownames(my_matrix) # No row names; 2 rows, need two names\n\nrownames(my_matrix) <- c(\"dogs\", \"cats\")\nmy_matrix # Now the rows have names!\nrownames(my_matrix) # Get them this way too!\n\n# Flash challenge: Name the columns of my_matrix \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" with colnames()\n\nmy_matrix\n\n# Should look like this:\n#      a b c d\n# dogs 2 3 4 5\n# cats 6 6 6 6\n\n# You can also slice out matrix portions by name\nmy_matrix[\"dogs\", c(\"b\", \"d\")]\n\n# Finally, functions act on values, not the index\nmean(my_matrix[\"dogs\", c(\"b\", \"d\")])\n\n\n\n2.4 Arrays\nArrays are data objects with more than 2 dimensions (well, technically a matrix with 2 dimensions is also an array, but let’s ignore that for now). Array dimensions are denoted as my_array[1:i, 1:j, 1:k], where i is the number of rows and j the columns and k the “depth” of i * j.\n\n\n\nmy_array\n\n\n## Arrays ####\n# Try this\n\n# help(runif)\n# help(round)\n# Try it to see what it does... \nmy_vec <- round(runif(n = 27, min = 0, max = 100), 0)\nmy_vec # See what we did there?\n\nlength(my_vec) # Just checking\n\nmy_array <- array(data = my_vec,\n                  dim = c(3, 3, 3))\nmy_array\n\n# Flash challenge: \n# Specify and print the 1st and 3rd  slice of the k dimension of my_array\n# Assuming my_array has dimensions i, j, k like my_array[i,j,k]"

    "text": "3 which() and subsetting\nSubsetting data objects is done by exploiting the index system. We usually do this by either specifying index values explicitly (effective, but it requires that you know A LOT about the data object), or by constructing queries that choose subset of data based on particular values. The which() function is a powerful way to construct queries.\n# Try this\nhelp(which) # Notice how the x argument is required to be a LOGICAL vector?\n\n# Make a NUMERIC vector\nvector_a <- c(3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7)\n\n# Use a boolean phrase to ask which elements of vector_a are greater than 5\nvector_a > 5 # Interesting... it is a LOGICAL vector!\n\n# which() will return the index values of TRUE values\n# In other words, WHICH values in vector_a are greater than 5?\nwhich(vector_a > 5)\n\nWhat is the point of all this?

    "section": "4 Selection on data.frame objects",
    "text": "4 Selection on data.frame objects\n\nData frames are the ultimate data object for getting, storing, organizing and analyzing data. A good scientist must learn to communicate the subtlety of data. A good statistician must learn not to underestimate the subtletly of data. A good student must learn that\n\nsubtlety may exist, even in simple data.\nThere are a couple of data object types that have a special characteristic in that they store data of different types, where vectors, matrices and arrays can only store one type of data (e.g., numeric, character, logical, etc.). The special data objects that can contain multiple data types are list objects, and data frames. Here we will focus on data frames.\nData frames can have different vector types arranged by column but there is a constraint that each vector must be the same length, that is, each ROW is considered an observation for each variable value (though there may be missing data coded by NA).\nThere are a few ways to think about selecting values in a data frame. The first is simply to access values through the variable names, which can either be done by using the data frame name with the $ operator and the variable name, or by using the [ , ] syntax with either the variable name or the column number of the variable of interest see here.\nA second powerful way to access variables in a data frame is by selecting particular rows of a data frame. This may be done by selecting the rows of a data based on values of one or more variables. We will practice doing this using which(), the [ , ] syntax, and boolean phrases is the following code block.\nFor the following section, we will use the OrchardSprays dataset that exists as a data frame in the in-built {datasets} package. You can use help(OrchardSprays) to see the help page (the help page is characteristically terse, so some description is given here.\n\nThe OrchardSprays experiment\nThis is a classic dataset based on an experiment looking at how a chemical additive could be used to deter honeybees from being attracted to crops and subsequently killed by pesticides.\nThe experiment involved having a treatment consisting of adding a “lime sulphur emulsion” (honeybee deterrent) in increasing concentrations to a sucrose solution. The treatment variable had 8 levels including a control (no deterrent) and 7 other levels with increasing concentration of the deterrent. The treatment levels were named A (the highest amount of deterrent), B (second highest deterrent) through to G (lowest deterrent) and H (control - no deterrent) The decrease variable was a measure of the quantity of sucrose solution that was taken by honeybees (the prediction here is that higher concentrations of the deterrent should result in a lower decrease in the sucrose solution).\nThe experiment involved a Latin Square design, with the order of the 8 treatments arranged randomly in an array of 8 columns (the purpose of this design is to randomize any effect of the treatment ORDER or POSITION on the response variable). This resulted in an 8 row by 8 column experiment. The response was measured after placing 100 honeybees into an experimental chamber with the 64 containers of sucrose solution.\n\n## OrchardSprays ####\n## Understand the data - an important step\n# Try this\n\n# Load the OrchardSpray data using the data() function\ndata(OrchardSprays) # Should see OrchardSprays <promise> in the Global Env.\n\n# Look at the data head()\nhead(OrchardSprays) # First 6 rows\n\n# Look at variable types with str()\nhelp(str) # Good function to see info about data object\nstr(OrchardSprays)\n\n# First let's just look at the data\n# Don't worry too much about the code for these graphs if you have not encountered it before\nboxplot(decrease ~ treatment, data = OrchardSprays, \n        main = \"The pattern fits the prediction\",\n        ylab = \"Amount of sucrose consumed\",\n        xlab = \"Lime sulpher treatment amount in decreasing order (H = control)\")\n\n# This is the experimental design\n# Latin Square is kind of like Sudoku\n# No treatment can be in row or column more than once\nplot(x = OrchardSprays$colpos,  # NB use of $ syntax to access data\n     y = OrchardSprays$rowpos, \n     pch = as.character(OrchardSprays$treatment),\n     xlim = c(0,9), ylim = c(0,9),\n     main = \"The Latin Square design of treatments\",\n     xlab = \"\\\"Column\\\" position\",\n     ylab = \"\\\"Row\\\" position\")\n\nPractice selecting parts a data frame\nSelecting particular parts of a data frame based on the values of one variable is a common and extremely useful task.\n## Practice selecting parts a data frame ####\n\n# Select the rows of the dataset for treatment \"D\"\n# (Pseudocode steps to solve) \n# Break it down to make small steps easy to read\n# 01 Boolean phrase to identify rows where treatment value is \"D\"\n# 02 which() to obtain index of TRUE in boolean vector\n# 03 Exploit [ , ] syntax with data frame object to slice out rows\n\n# 01 Boolean phrase\nOrchardSprays$treatment # Just print variable to compare visually to boolean\nOrchardSprays$treatment == \"D\" # logical vector - TRUE in \"D\" positions\n\n# 02 which()\nwhich(OrchardSprays$treatment == \"D\") # Index of TRUE values\nmy_selection <- which(OrchardSprays$treatment == \"D\") # Place index in a variable\nmy_selection # Just checking\n\n# 03 Exploit [ , ] syntax with data frame object to slice out rows\nOrchardSprays[my_selection, ]\n\n# Flash challenge: Select and print all rows at \"colpos\" values of 2\n\nSelection based on more than one variable value\nUsing the basic building blocks of boolean selection, more complex rules for selecting data can be made.\n## Compound boolean for selection ####\n\n# Select all rows of the data frame where \n# rowpos equals 4 OR 6 AND treatment equals \"A\" OR \"H\"\n# What we expect is exactly 2 values (A or H) for each powpos (4 or 6)\n\n# rowpos 4 and 6\nOrchardSprays$rowpos == 4 # The 4s\nOrchardSprays$rowpos == 6 # The 6s\n\nOrchardSprays$rowpos == 4 | OrchardSprays$rowpos == 6 # All together\n\n# now with which()\nwhich(OrchardSprays$rowpos == 4) # The 4s\nwhich(OrchardSprays$rowpos == 6) # The 6s\n\nwhich(OrchardSprays$rowpos == 4 | OrchardSprays$rowpos == 6) # All together\n\n# treatment A and H\nwhich(OrchardSprays$treatment == \"A\" | OrchardSprays$treatment == \"H\") # All together\n\n# Now we need the intersection of value that are in both our which() vectors\n\nwhich((OrchardSprays$rowpos == 4 | OrchardSprays$rowpos == 6) &  # It works\n        (OrchardSprays$treatment == \"A\" | OrchardSprays$treatment == \"H\") ) \n  \n# NB this is a long way of spelling out our selection, \n# but trying to be very explicit with what is going on\n\nmy_selec2 <- which((OrchardSprays$rowpos == 4 | OrchardSprays$rowpos == 6) &  \n                     (OrchardSprays$treatment == \"A\" | OrchardSprays$treatment == \"H\") ) \n\nOrchardSprays[my_selec2, ] # Double check it works and is similar to expectation...\n\n# Flash challenge: Calculate the mean of decrease for treatment \"A\" \n# and the mean of decrease for treatment \"H\"\n\n\n1.5.4 Using aggregate()\nThe aggregate() function\nWe often may wish to summarise parts of a data set according to some index of variable values.

R has grown in popularity recently and is used extensively by universities, companies, and researchers everywhere. Because of this, there is a very large community of users and a demand in business and academia for skills using R.\nR is free and open source. R is easy to learn and works the same for folks with fast and slow computers, no matter what kind of operating system or computer they like to use, and it is easy to use via the web on any device."

There are many features of RStudio, but we are only going to point out a few. One of the most useful features is syntax highlighting, that gives visual cues to help you write computer code.\n\n\n\n\nRStudio layout\n\n\n\nBe aware (beware?) of:\nThe Script window\nThe script window is located in the upper right of the RStudio console by default. You may need to open a script or start a new one: File > New File > R Script (hotkey Ctrl+Shift+N).\nThe script window is where you are likely to spend most of your time building scripts and executing commands you write. You can have many scripts open at the same time (in “tabs”), and you can have different kinds of scripts, e.g., for different parts of a project or even for programming languages.\n\nThe Console window\nThe Console window is in the lower left by default. Notice there are several other tabs visible, but we will only mention the Console for now. The Console is the place where text outputs will be printed (e.g. the results of statistical tests), and also is a place where R will print Warning and Error messages.\n\nThe Global Environment\nThe Global Environment is in the Environment tab in the upper right of RStudio by default. This pane is useful in displaying data objects that you have loaded and available.\n\nThe Plots window\nThe Plots window is a tab in the lower right by default. This is the place where graphics output is displayed and where plots can be named, resized, copied and saved. There are some other important tabs here as well, which you can also explore. When a new plot is produced, the Plots tab will become active."

    "section": "6 Workflow for R scripts",
    "text": "6 Workflow for R scripts\nScript setup\nAn R script is a plain text file where the file name ends in “dot R” (.R) by default.\nAn R script serves several purposes:\nFirst, it documents your analysis allowing it to be reproduced exactly by yourself (your future self!) or by others like collaborators, friends, colleagues, your professor, your student, etc.\nSecond, it is the interface between your commands and R software.\nA goal is that your scripts should contain only important R commands and information, in an organized and logical way that has meaning for other people, maybe for people you have never spoken to. A typical way to achieve this is to organize every script according to the same plan.\n\n\nYour R script should be a file good enough to show to a person in the future (like a supervisor, or even your future self). Someone who can help you, but also someone who you may not be able to explain the contents to. The script should be documented and complete. Think of this future person as a friend you respect.\n\n\nAlthough there are many ways to achieve this, for the purposes of the Bootcamp we strongly encourage you to organize you scripts like this:\n\nHeader\nContents\nOne separate section for each item of contents\n\n\nHeader\nStart every script with a Header, that contains your name, the date of the most recent edit, and a short description of the PURPOSE of the script.\n# A typical script Header\n\n## HEADER ####\n## Who: <your name>\n## What: My first script\n## Last edited: yyyy-mm-dd (ISO 8601 date format... Google it!)\n####\n\n\n6.1 Contents\nA Contents section should also be present near the top, to provide a road map for the analysis.\n# A typical script Contents section\n\n## CONTENTS ####\n## 00 Setup\n## 01 Graphs\n## 02 Analysis\n## 03 Etc\n\n\n\n6.2 Section for each item of contents\nFinally, code chunk breaks should be used to aid the readability of the script and to provide a section for each item in your table of contents. A code chunk is just a section of code set off from other sections.\nBelow is the beginning of a typical code chunk in an R script.\n\nCode chunks must start with at least one hash sign “#”,\nshould have a title descriptive of code chunk contents,\nand end with (at least) four hash signs “####”\nconsecutively numbered titles makes things very tidy\n\n## 01 This here is the first line of MY CODE CHUNK ####\n\nWe will practice each of these components.\n\n\n\n6.3 Comments\nComments are messages that explain code in your script, and they should be used throughout every script. You can think of comments like the methods section of a scientific paper - there should be enough detail to exactly replicate and understand the script, but it should also be concise.\nComment lines begin with the # character and are not treated as “code” by R.\n\n# Make a vector of numbers <--- a comment\nmy_variable <- c(2,5,3,6,3,4,7)\n\n# Calculate the mean of my_variable <--- another comment\nmean(my_variable)\n\n[1] 4.285714\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4 Submitting commands\nA final thing that must be mentioned here is how to actually submit commands in your R script for R to execute. There are a few ways to do this.\n\nrun the whole line of code your cursor rests on (no selection) Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Return in Macs)\nrun code you have selected with your cursor Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Return in Macs).\nUse the “Run” button along the top of the Script window\nRun code from the menu Code > Run Selected Line(s)."

Run the code in the script using one of the methods above, and examine the output in the Console window.\n\n\n\n7.2\nAdd a code chunk title to your CONTENTS section and to your script. Make sure to write brief comments for your code. Add the following code to your chunk run it and examine the output:\nDon’t worry about understanding the code for now. We are just working on interfacing with R and submitting commands.\n# Create a new variable\nmy_variable <- c(6.5, 1.35, 3.5)\n\n# Calculate the mean of my_variable\nmean(my_variable)\n\n# Calculate the standard deviation of my_variable\nsd(my_variable)"
