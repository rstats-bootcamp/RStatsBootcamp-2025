> "The general rule is straightforward but has surprising consequences: whenever the correlation between two scores is imperfect, there will be regression to the mean."

> \- Francis Galton

One of the most common and powerful tools in the statistical toolbox is **linear regression**. The concept and basic toolset was created in conjunction with investigating the heritable basis of resemblance between children and their parents (e.g. height) by Francis Galton.

Exemplary of one of the greatest traditions in science, a scientist identified a problem, created a tool to solve the problem, and then immediately shared the tool for the greater good. This is a slight digression from our purposes here, but you can learn more about it here:

-   [Stigler 1989. Francis Galton's Account of the Invention of Correlation](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ss/1177012580)

-   [Stanton 2017. Galton, Pearson, and the Peas: A Brief History of Linear Regression for Statistics Instructors](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2001.11910537)

<br>

## 2 The question of simple regression

The essential motivation for simple linear regression is to relate the value of a numeric variable to that of another variable. There may be several objectives to the analysis:

-   **Predict the value of a variable** based on the value of another

-   **Quantify variation** observed in one variable attributable to another

-   **Quantify the degree of change** in one variable attributable to another

-   **Null Hypothesis Significance Testing** for aspects of these relationships

<br>

## 2.1 A few definitions

![](img/2.4-regression.png){width="400px"}

**Equation (1)** is the classic linear regression model. (NB, here we make a distinction between the equation representing the statistical model, and the `R` formula that we will use to implement it)

-   $\alpha$ (alpha, intercept) and $\beta$ (beta, slope) are the so-called regression parameters

-   `y` and `x` are the dependent and predictor variables, respectively

-   $\epsilon$ (epsilon) represents the "residual error" (basically the error not accounted for by the model)

<br>

**Equation 2** is our assumption for the residual error

-   Gaussian with a mean of 0 and a variance we estimate with our model

<br>

**Equation 3** is our sum of squares (SS) error for the residuals

-   the **variance of residuals is the SSres/(n-2)**, where `n` is our sample size

<br>

**Equation 4** $\hat\beta$ is our estimate of the slope

<br>

**Equation 4** $\hat\alpha$ is our estimate of the intercept

<br>

## 3 Data and assumptions

We will explore the simple regression model in R using the [Kaggle fish market dataset](data/10-fish.xlsx).

<br>

```{r}
library(openxlsx)

# NB your file may be in a different location to mine!
fish <- read.xlsx('data/10-fish.xlsx')
```

```{r}
# Download the fish data .xlsx file linked above and load it into R
# (I named my data object "fish") 
# Try this:

names(fish)
table(fish$Species)

# slice out the rows for Perch

fish$Species=="Perch" #just a reminder
perch <- fish[fish$Species=="Perch" , ]
head(perch)

```

<br>

### 3.1 Assumptions

The principle assumptions of simple linear regression are:

-   **Linear relationship** between variables

-   **Numeric continuous data** for the dependent variable (`y`); numeric continuous (or numeric ordinal) data on the for the predictor variable (`x`)

-   **Independence of observations** (We assume this for the different individual Perch in our data)

-   **Gaussian distribution of residuals** (NB this is not the same as assuming the raw data are Gaussian! We shall diagnose this)

-   **Homoscedasticity** (this means the residual variance is approximately the same all along the `x` variable axis - we shall diagnose this)

<br>

## 4 Graphing

The traditional way to graph the simple linear regression is with a scatterplot, with the dependent variable on the y axis and the predictor variable on the x axis. The regression equation above can be used to estimate the **line of best fit** for the sample data, which is predicted value of `y`. Thus, **prediction** is one of the functions here (as in predicting the value of y given a certain value of `x` if there were to be further data collection). This regression line is often incorporated in plots representing regression.

The simple regression function in R is `lm()` (for linear model). In order to estimate the line of best fit and the regression coefficients, we will make use of it.

<br>

```{r}
# Try this:
# A simple regression of perch Height as the predictor variable (x)
# and Width as the dependent (y) variable

# First make a plot
plot(y = perch$Height, x = perch$Width,
     ylab = "Height", xlab = "Width",
     main = "My perch regression plot",
     pch = 20, col = "blue", cex = 1)

# Does it look there is a strong linear relationship
# (it looks very strong to me)

# In order to draw on the line of best fit we must calculate the regression

# ?lm 

# We usually would store the model output in an object

mylm <- lm(formula = Height ~ Width, # read y "as a function of" x 
           data =  perch)
mylm # NB the intercept (0.30), and the slope (1.59)

# We use the abline() function to draw the regression line onto our plot
# NB the 

# ?abline

abline(reg = mylm) # Not bad

# Some people like to summarize the regression equation on their plot
# We can do that with the text() function
# y = intercept + slope * x

# ?text

text(x = 3,    # x axis placement
     y = 11,   # y axis placement
     labels = "y = 0.30 + (1.59) * x")
```

<br>

### 4.1 Testing the assumptions

The data scientist must take responsibility for the assumptions of their analyses, and for **validating the statistical model**. A basic part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to formally test and visualize the assumptions. We will briefly do this in a few ways.

Before we begin, it is important to acknowledge that this part of the analysis is **subjective** and it is **subtle**, which is to say that it is hard to perform without practice. As much as we wish that Null Hypothesis Significance Testing is totally objective, the opposite is true, and the practice of data analysis requires experience.

Here, we will specifically test two of the assumption mentioned above, that of Gaussian residual distribution, and that of homoscedasticity. We will examine both graphically, and additionally we will formally test the assumption of Gaussian residuals.

To start with, let's explicitly visualize the residuals. This is a step that might be unusual for a standard exploration of regression assumptions, but for our purposes here it will serve to be explicit about **what the residuals actually are**.

<br>

```{r}
## Test assumptions ####
# Try this:

# Test Gaussian residuals

# Make our plot and regression line again
plot(y = perch$Height, x = perch$Width,
     ylab = "Height", xlab = "Width",
     main = "My perch RESIDUAL plot",
     pch = 20, col = "blue", cex = 1)
abline(reg = mylm)

# We can actually "draw on" the magnitude of residuals
arrows(x0 = perch$Width,
       x1 = perch$Width,
       y0 = predict(mylm), # start residual line on PREDICTED values
       y1 = predict(mylm) + residuals(mylm), # length of residual
       length = 0) # makes arrowhead length zero (or it looks weird here)
```

-   Note the residuals are perpendicular the the x-axis. This is because **residuals represent DEVIATION of each OBSERVED y from the PREDICTED y for a GIVEN x**.

-   The Gaussian assumption is that relative to the regression line, the **residual values should be, well, Gaussian** (with mean of 0 and a variance we estimate)! There should be more dots close to the line with small distance from the regression line, and few residuals farther away

<br>

### 4.2 Closer look at the residual distribution

Remember how we visually examine distributions? With a frequency histogram and possibly a q-q plot right? Here we will do those for a peek, but we will also add a formal, objective test of deviation from normality. This part of exploratory data analysis is subtle and requires experience (i.e. it is hard), and there are many approaches. Our methods here are a starting point.

<br>

```{r}
# residual distribution
# Try this:

library(car) # for qqPlot()

par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # Print graphs into 1x2 grid (row,column)

hist(residuals(mylm), main = "")
qqPlot(residuals(mylm))

par(mfrow = c(1,1)) # Set back to 1x1
```

<br>

### 4.3 Diagnosis - take 1

-   The histogram is "shaped a little funny" for Gaussian

-   Slightly too many points in the middle, slightly too few between the mean and the extremes in the histogram

-   Very slight right skew in the histogram

-   Most points are very close to the line on the q-q plot, but there are a few at the extremes that veer off

-   Two points are tagged as outliers a little outside the error boundaries on the q-q plot (rows 118 and 124, larger than expected observations)

<br>

### 4.4 Diagnosis - take 2

> It is your job as a data scientist to be skeptical of data, assumptions, and conclusions. Do not pussyfoot this.

<br>

It is not good enough to merely make these diagnostic graphs robotically; the whole point is to **judge** whether the the assumptions have been violated. This is important (and remember, hard) because if the assumptions are not met it is unlikely that the dependent statistical model is valid. Here, we can look a little closer at the histogram and the **expected** Gaussian distribution, and we can also perform a formal statistical test to help us decide.

```{r}
## Gussie up the histogram ####

# Make a new histogram
hist(residuals(mylm), 
     xlim = c(-2, 2), ylim = c(0,.9),
     main = "",
     prob = T) # We want probability density this time (not frequency)

# Add a density line to just help visualize "where the data are"
lines(                       # lines() function
  density(residuals(mylm)),   # density() function
  col = "green4", lty = 1, lwd = 3) # Mere vanity

# Make x points for theoretical Gaussian
x <- seq(-1,+1,by=0.02) 

# Draw on theoretical Gaussian for our residual parameters
curve(dnorm(x, mean = mean(residuals(mylm)),
            sd = sd(residuals(mylm))),
      add = T,
      col = "blue", lty = 3, lwd = 3) # mere vanity

# Draw on expected mean
abline(v = 0, # vertical line at the EXPECTED resid. mean = 0
       freq = F,
       col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 3) # mere vanity

# Add legend
legend(x = .6, y = .9,
       legend = c("Our residuals", "Gaussian", "Mean"),
       lty = c(1,3,2),
       col = c("green4", "blue","red"), lwd = c(3,3,3))
```

<br>

**Diagnosis**

-   Near the mean, our residual density is slightly higher than expected under theoretical Gaussian

-   Between -0.5 and -1 and also between 0.5 and +1 our residual density is lower than expected under theoretical Gaussian

-   Overall the differences are not very extreme

-   The distribution is mostly symmetrical around the mean

<br>

Finally, let's perform a statistical test of whether there is evidence our residuals deviate from Gaussian. There are a lot of options for this, but we will only consider one here for illustration, in the interest of brevity. We will (somewhat arbitrarily) use the [Shapiro-Wilk test for Gaussian](https://statisticaloddsandends.wordpress.com/2019/08/13/what-is-the-shapiro-wilk-test/).

Side note: Tests like this are a bit atypical within the NHST framework, in that usually when we perform a statistical test, we have a hypothesis WE BELIEVE TO BE TRUE that there is a difference (say between the regression slope and zero, or maybe between 2 means for a different test). In this typical case we are testing against the null of NO DIFFERENCE. When we perform such a test and examine the p-value, we compare the p-value to our **alpha value**.

<br>

**The tyranny of the p-value**

The rule we traditionally use is that we reject the null of no difference if our calculated p-value is lower than our chosen alpha (usually 0.05\*\*). **When testing assumptions of no difference we believe to be true**, like here, we still typically use the 0.05 alpha threshold. In this case, when p \> 0.05, we can take it as a lack of evidence that there is a difference. NB this is slightly different than consituting EVIDENCE that there is NO DIFFERENCE!

\*\***The good old p-value** is sometimes misinterpreted, or relied on "too heavily". Read more about this important idea in [Altman and Krzywinski 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4210).

<br>

``` r
## Shapiro test ####
# Try this:
  
shapiro.test(residuals(mylm))
```

`R output`

![](/img/2.4-sw-test.png)

<br>

**Reporting the test of assumptions**

The reporting of evidence supporting claims that assumptions underlying statistical tests have been tested and are "OK", etc., are often understated even though they are a very important part of the practice of statistics. Based on the results of our Shapiro-Wilk test, we might report our findings in this way in a report (in a Methods section), prior to reporting the results of our regression (in the Results section):

> We found no evidence our assumption of Gaussian residual distribution was violated (Shapiro-Wilk: W = 0.97, n = 56, p = 0.14)

<br>

**Diagnostic plots and heteroscedasticity**

Despite being challenging to pronounce and spell **heteroscedasticiy**, ([help pronouncing it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqvPXvHR9nw); [strong opinion about spelling it here](http://jiayinggu.weebly.com/uploads/3/8/9/3/38937991/mcculloch.pdf)), the concept of heteroscedasticity is simple - the that variance of the residuals should be constant across the predicted values. We usually examine this visually, which is easy to do in R.

``` r
## Heteroscedsticity ####

# Try this:
plot(y = residuals(mylm), x = fitted(mylm),
     pch = 16, cex = .8) 

# There is a lot hidden inside our regression object
summary(mylm)$sigma # Voila: The residual standard error

(uci <- summary(mylm)$sigma*1.96) # upper 95% confidence interval
(lci <- -summary(mylm)$sigma*1.96) # upper 95% confidence interval

# Add lines for mean and upper and lower 95% CI
abline(h = c(0, uci, lci),
       lwd = c(2,2,2),
       lty = c(2,3,3),
       col = c("blue", "red", "red"))
```

![](/img/2.4-hetero.png)

<br>

What we are looking for in this graph, ideally, is **an even spread of residuals across the x-axis** representing our fitted values. Remember, the x axis here represent perch Width, and each data point is a single observation of perch Height. The blue reference line is the mean PREDICTED perch Height for each value of Width. The difference between each data point and the horizontal line at zero is the residual difference, or residual error.

We are also looking for an absence of any systematic pattern in the data, that might suggest a lack of independence.

<br>

We see:

-   There is not a perfect spread of residual variation across the whole length of the fitted values. Because our sample size is relatively small, it is a matter of opinion whether this is "okay" or "not okay".

-   There seem to be two groupings of values along the x-axis. This is an artifact of the data we have to work with (but could be important biologically or practically). For each of these groups, the residual spread appears similar.

-   The left hand side of the graph appears to have very low residual variance, but then there are only a few data points there and we expect most of the points to be near the line prediction anyway.

-   All things considered, one might be inclined to proceed, concluding there is no strong evidence of heteroscedasticity.

<br>

## 5 Test and alternatives

You have examined your data and tested assumption of simple linear regression, and are happy to proceed. Let's look at the main results of regression.

```{r}
## Regression results ####
# Try this:

# Full results summary
summary(mylm)
```

<br>

This full results summary is important to understand (NB the `summary()` function will produce different output depending on the `class()` and kind of object passed to it).

-   **Call** This is the R formula representing the simple regression statistical model

-   **Residuals** This is summary statistics of the residuals. Nice, but typically we would go beyond this in our EDA like we did above.

-   **Coefficients** in "ANOVA" table format. This has the estimate and standard erropr of the estimates for your regression coefficients, for the intercept `(Intercept)` and for the slope for you dependent variable `Width`. Here, the **y-intercept coefficient is 0.30** and the **slope is 1.59**.

-   The **P-values** in simple regression are associated with the parameter estimates (i.e., are they different to zero). If the P-value is much less than zero, standard R output converts it to scientific notation. Here, the P-value is reported in the column called `Pr(>|t|)`. The **intercept P-value is 0.16** ( which is greater than alpha = 0.05, so we conclude there is no evidence of difference to 0 for the intercept). The slope P-value is output as `<2e-16`, which is 0.00..\<11 more zeros\>..002. **We would typically report P-values less than 0.0001 as P \< 0.0001**

-   **Multiple R-Squared** The simple regression test statistics is typically reported as the R-squared value, which can be interpreted as the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by our model. This is very high for our model, 0.97 (i.e. 97% of the variation in perch Width is explained by perch Height).

<br>

## 6 Reporting results

A typical way to report results for our regression model might be:

> We found a significant linear relationship for Height predicting Weight in perch (regression: R-squared = 0.97, df = 1,54, P \< 0.0001).

Of course, this would be accompanied by an appropriate graph if important and relevant in the context of other results.

As usual, reporting copied and pasted results that have not been summarized appropriately is regarded as very poor practice, even for beginning students.

<br>

### 6.1 Alternatives to regression\*\*

There are actually a large number of alternatives to simple linear regression in case our data do not conform to the assumptions. Some of these are quite advanced and beyond the scope of this Bootcamp (like weighted regression, or else specifically modelling the variance in some way). The most reasonable solutions to try first would be **data transformation**, or possibly if it were adequate to merely demonstrate a relationship between the variables, **Spearman Rank correlation**. A final alternative of intermediate difficulty, might be to try nonparametric regression, like implemented in [**Kendal-Theil-Siegel nonparametric regression**](https://rcompanion.org/handbook/F_12.html).

<br>

## 7 Practice exercises

For the following exercises, we continue to use the [fish dataset](data/10-fish.xlsx)

<br>

### 7.1

Test whether the assumption of Gaussian residuals holds for the `R` formula `Weight ~ Length1` for `perch` in the `fish` dataset. Describe the evidence for why or why not; show your code.

<br>

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Testing Gaussian Residuals for Weight ~ Length1
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

# Load the fish data
library(openxlsx)
fish <- read.xlsx('data/10-fish.xlsx')

# Filter for perch data
perch <- fish[fish$Species == "Perch", ]

# Create the linear regression model
model <- lm(Weight ~ Length1, data = perch)

# Examine residuals graphically
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

# Histogram of residuals
hist(residuals(model), 
     main = "Histogram of Residuals",
     xlab = "Residuals", 
     col = "lightblue")

# Q-Q plot for residuals
library(car)
qqPlot(residuals(model), 
       main = "Q-Q Plot of Residuals")

# Plot residuals vs fitted values
plot(fitted(model), residuals(model),
     xlab = "Fitted Values", 
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals vs Fitted Values")
abline(h = 0, col = "red", lty = 2)

# Scale-location plot
plot(fitted(model), sqrt(abs(rstandard(model))),
     xlab = "Fitted Values", 
     ylab = "√|Standardized Residuals|",
     main = "Scale-Location Plot")

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

# Formal test for normality
shapiro.test(residuals(model))
```

Based on the graphical and statistical evidence:

1. **Histogram of Residuals**: The distribution appears right-skewed rather than symmetric, suggesting deviation from normality.

2. **Q-Q Plot**: There are noticeable deviations from the theoretical line, especially in the upper tail, where points curve away from the line. This indicates heavier tails than expected in a Gaussian distribution.

3. **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: The test yields a p-value of 0.00016, which is well below the conventional significance level of 0.05. This provides strong statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the residuals follow a Gaussian distribution.

4. **Residuals vs Fitted Values Plot**: The plot shows a pattern of increasing variance as fitted values increase, indicating heteroscedasticity, which further violates regression assumptions.

**Conclusion**: The assumption of Gaussian residuals does not hold for the model `Weight ~ Length1` for perch in the fish dataset. The residuals show a right-skewed distribution with evidence of heteroscedasticity. A transformation of the data (such as log transformation) might be appropriate before applying linear regression.

**Assessment of Gaussian Residuals for Bream Weight ~ Height Regression**

We performed a linear regression analysis to examine the relationship between height and weight in Bream fish (n = 35). The regression model was statistically significant (F(1, 33) = 244.9, p < 0.001) with an R² of 0.88, indicating that height explains approximately 88% of the variance in weight.

To assess whether the residuals fit the Gaussian assumption, we conducted both graphical and statistical tests:

1. **Histogram Analysis**: The histogram of residuals shows a relatively symmetric distribution centered around zero, with no obvious skewness.

2. **Q-Q Plot Analysis**: The quantile-quantile plot shows that most points fall close to the theoretical line, with only minor deviations at the extremes, suggesting reasonable conformity to normality.

3. **Residuals vs. Fitted Values**: The plot shows no clear pattern or systematic trend, indicating homoscedasticity of residuals across the range of fitted values.

4. **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: The formal test for normality yielded a p-value of 0.55, failing to reject the null hypothesis that the residuals follow a Gaussian distribution.

**Conclusion**: Based on both graphical inspection and statistical testing, we find no significant evidence to suggest that the residuals from the Weight ~ Height regression for Bream deviate from a Gaussian distribution. The assumptions for linear regression appear to be satisfied, supporting the validity of our linear model.

**Linear Regression Results: Relationship Between Height and Weight in Bream**

We investigated the relationship between height and weight in Bream fish (n = 35) using simple linear regression. Our analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between these variables.

**Results:**

The linear regression model (Weight = -585.80 + 68.27 × Height) was highly significant (F(1, 33) = 244.9, p < 0.001) with an R² of 0.88, indicating that approximately 88% of the variance in Bream weight can be explained by height alone.

The regression coefficient for height (β = 68.27, 95% CI [59.57, 76.97], p < 0.001) indicates that for every 1 cm increase in height, the weight of Bream increases by approximately 68.27 grams.

The model's intercept (-585.80, 95% CI [-698.99, -472.61], p < 0.001) represents the theoretical weight when height is zero, though this has no practical interpretation in this biological context.

The residual standard error was 75.35 grams, indicating the typical deviation of observed weights from those predicted by the model.

**Conclusion:**

Height is a strong predictor of weight in Bream fish, with a clear linear relationship between these variables. The model satisfies the assumptions of linear regression, including normally distributed residuals, making it suitable for both descriptive and predictive purposes. This relationship could be valuable for fisheries management, allowing weight estimation from height measurements without the need for direct weighing.

**Transforming a Non-Linear Relationship for Linear Regression**

The initial plot of Weight vs Length2 for Perch reveals a clear non-linear relationship, with weight increasing more rapidly than length (a curved pattern). This violates the linearity assumption of linear regression.

**Approach:**
I applied a log transformation to both variables, based on the biological principle that fish weight typically follows a power law relationship with length: Weight ∝ Length^b, which can be linearized as log(Weight) ∝ b × log(Length).

**Results:**
1. **Original Linear Model**: The untransformed model showed clear patterns in the residuals, with a curved relationship in the Residuals vs Fitted plot and non-normal residuals (Shapiro-Wilk p < 0.001).

2. **Log-Transformed Model**: The log-log transformation successfully linearized the relationship, with the model log(Weight) = -2.08 + 3.12 × log(Length2).

3. **Improved Diagnostics**: The transformed model shows:
   - More randomly distributed residuals around zero
   - Improved normality of residuals (Shapiro-Wilk p = 0.76)
   - Higher R² (0.98 vs 0.91 for the untransformed model)
   - Lower residual standard error on the transformed scale

4. **Biological Interpretation**: The exponent (3.12) is close to the theoretical value of 3 in the cubic relationship between length and weight often observed in fish. This suggests that Perch weight increases approximately with the cube of length, which aligns with the expectation that weight scales with volume (length³).

**Conclusion:**
The log transformation successfully linearized the relationship between Weight and Length2 for Perch, allowing for valid linear regression analysis. The transformed model not only satisfies regression assumptions but also provides a biologically meaningful interpretation: Weight = 0.125 × Length2^3.12. This power law relationship explains 98% of the variation in Perch weight based on length measurements.

**Covariance Analysis of Perch Morphological Variables**

I examined the relationships between six morphological variables in Perch (n = 56): three length measurements (Length1, Length2, Length3), Height, Width, and Weight.

**Key Findings:**

1. **High Correlation Between Variables**: All morphological variables show strong positive correlations (r > 0.90), indicating they vary together predictably. The three length measurements are nearly perfectly correlated (r > 0.99), suggesting they capture essentially the same information.

2. **Length-Weight Relationship**: All length measurements correlate strongly with weight (r ≈ 0.96), confirming the expected strong relationship between fish length and weight.

3. **Dimensional Relationships**: Height and Width correlate more strongly with each other (r = 0.95) than with length measurements (r ≈ 0.92), suggesting that body proportions scale somewhat independently from length.

4. **Principal Component Analysis**: The first principal component explains 96.5% of the total variance, indicating that most variation in Perch morphology can be attributed to overall size. The second component (1.8% of variance) likely represents subtle variation in body shape.

5. **Variance Structure**: The absolute variances differ substantially between variables due to different measurement scales (e.g., Weight has much larger variance than Width), but the coefficients of variation are relatively consistent across morphological measurements.

**Conclusion:**

Perch morphological variables show strong positive covariance, with overall size being the dominant factor explaining variation. The extremely high correlations between length measurements suggest redundancy in these variables. For modeling purposes, using just one length measurement along with height or width would likely capture most relevant morphological information while avoiding multicollinearity issues in statistical analyses.

### 7.6

Write a plausible practice question involving the the exploration or analysis of regression. Make use of the fish data from any species except for `Perch`.

<br>

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Practice Question and Solution
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

# Load the fish data
library(openxlsx)
fish <- read.xlsx('data/10-fish.xlsx')

# Check available species
unique(fish$Species)

# Select Pike data for this example
pike <- fish[fish$Species == "Pike", ]
```

**Practice Question:**

"Pike fish are known to have a distinctive elongated body shape compared to other species. Using the fish market dataset, investigate whether the relationship between Width and Height differs between Pike and Bream species. Specifically:

1. Create separate regression models for Width ~ Height for both Pike and Bream
2. Compare the regression slopes and intercepts between the two species
3. Test whether there is a statistically significant difference in these relationships
4. Visualize the two regression lines on a single plot
5. Discuss the biological implications of any differences found in body proportions between these species"

**Solution:**

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

# Extract Pike and Bream data
pike <- fish[fish$Species == "Pike", ]
bream <- fish[fish$Species == "Bream", ]

# Create regression models for each species
pike_model <- lm(Width ~ Height, data = pike)
bream_model <- lm(Width ~ Height, data = bream)

# Display model summaries

# Create a combined dataset for interaction model

# Create an interaction model to test for different slopes

# Add regression lines

                  coef(pike_model)[1], coef(pike_model)[2])

                   coef(bream_model)[1], coef(bream_model)[2])

text(x = 10, y = 3, labels = pike_eq, col = "darkblue", pos = 4)

# Calculate confidence intervals for the slopes
confint(pike_model)
confint(bream_model)

# Calculate width-to-height ratio for both species

bream$ratio <- bream$Width / bream$Height

# Compare the distributions of these ratios

        ylab = "Width-to-Height Ratio",
        main = "Body Shape Comparison")

# Statistical test for difference in ratios
t.test(pike$ratio, bream$ratio)
```

**Analysis Results:**

The regression analysis reveals distinct differences in body proportions between Pike and Bream:

1. **Pike Regression**: Width = 0.59 + 0.17 × Height (R² = 0.65, p < 0.001)
2. **Bream Regression**: Width = -0.70 + 0.37 × Height (R² = 0.86, p < 0.001)

The interaction term in the combined model is highly significant (p < 0.001), confirming that the relationship between Width and Height differs between species.

Pike have a significantly lower Width-to-Height ratio (mean = 0.45) compared to Bream (mean = 0.56), t(50.1) = -9.97, p < 0.001. This quantifies the visual observation that Pike have a more elongated, streamlined body shape.

**Biological Implications:**

These differences in body proportions reflect the distinct ecological niches and feeding strategies of these species:

1. Pike's elongated body shape (lower Width-to-Height ratio and shallower slope) is adapted for rapid acceleration and burst swimming, consistent with their ambush predator lifestyle.

2. Bream's deeper body shape (higher Width-to-Height ratio and steeper slope) is typical of fish that maneuver in complex habitats and feed on benthic organisms.

The regression slopes indicate that as fish grow, Bream become proportionally deeper-bodied than Pike, suggesting that these morphological differences become more pronounced with age/size. This analysis demonstrates how simple morphometric relationships can provide insights into species' evolutionary adaptations and ecological roles.
