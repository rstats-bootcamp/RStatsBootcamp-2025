# Explore Data

## Learning Objectives
- Formulate appropriate statistical questions
- Perform hypothesis testing using NHST framework
- Summarize what "Weighing the Pig" means
- Distinguish between Analysis versus EDA

## Question, Explore, Analyze Workflow
- Dataset often comes in imperfect state
- First task is to "weigh the pig" - understand data
- Order: Question, Explore, Analyze
- Choose analysis prior to collecting first data point

## Weighing the Pig Concept
- Term for creating summary-at-a-glance of dataset
- Includes graphics, statistical summary, and data amount
- Key consideration: specification of variables
- Best way to gain skill: practice with data

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Examine variables: are they as expected?
- Graph data and examine numerical summaries
- Look for errors both trivial and serious
- May take large proportion of analysis time

## Question Formulation and NHST
- Null Hypothesis Significance Testing framework
- Population of interest cannot be directly measured
- Experimental samples drawn randomly from population
- Test statistics compared to expected under null hypothesis

## NHST Core Components
- Null hypothesis: consistent with no effect
- P-value: probability observed effect due to chance
- Alpha value: maximum acceptable probability of error (0.05)
- Alternative hypothesis: effect we predict to be true

## Variables and Graphing Principles
- Good graph tells whole story
- Bad graph worse than no graph at all
- Distinction between EDA graphs and evidence graphs
- Must convey relevant information and be self-contained

## Scientific Graph Requirements
- Reflect hypothesis or statistical concept
- Appropriate to the data being analyzed
- Consistent in aesthetics throughout
- Build up information in layers

## Analysis versus EDA Distinction
- Analysis: generates evidence, fits specific question
- EDA: informal exploration and assumptions testing
- Analysis designed for others, EDA usually private
- Both essential parts of complete data analysis process

## Statistical Analysis Plan Concept
- Formal document connecting hypothesis to analysis method
- Created before any data collection begins
- Specifies hypotheses, statistical models, and data collection
- Effect size and sample size justification included

## Modern Scientific Method
- Traditional cycle inadequate for best practice
- Analysis planning must occur with hypothesis formulation
- Experimental design phase with power analysis
- Statistical analysis plan produced prior to data collection
