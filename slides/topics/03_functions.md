# R Functions

## Learning Objectives
- Describe what functions do and how they work
- Use functions effectively with the help system
- Understand what packages are and their purpose
- Find, download, and use R packages

## The Garage and Toolbox Metaphor
- R functions are tools that do work for you
- Packages are toolboxes containing related functions
- R comes with many packages, thousands more available
- Functions grouped by task focus and functionality

## Function Basics
- Generic format: function_name()
- Function name with required bracket notation
- R is case sensitive for function names
- Details like capitalization matter significantly

## Using Functions
- Input information or data into function brackets
- Function output is the work being done
- Arguments have unique names and values
- Use equals sign for argument assignment

## Common Function Names
- Often easy to guess: mean(), log(), sd()
- plot(), boxplot(), help() for common tasks
- Names usually reflect their purpose clearly
- Help pages essential for learning usage

## Function Arguments
- Each argument has unique name
- Values assigned using equals sign
- Arguments separated by commas
- Optional arguments indicated by "..."

## Getting Help with Functions
- Use help() function as reference for arguments
- Essential until you memorize common functions
- Check Usage and Arguments sections carefully
- Key to learning R in easiest way

## R Packages
- Toolboxes built to solve specific problems
- Open source and freely available
- Download when you identify need for functions
- Over 18,000 packages currently available

## Installing and Loading Packages
- Step 1: install.packages("package_name")
- Step 2: library("package_name")
- Installing downloads from remote repository
- Loading makes functions available for use

## RStudio Package Management
- Use Packages tab in lower right pane
- Click radio button to load packages
- Click Install button to install new packages
- Search official CRAN repository by default

## Best Practices
- Always get help page up as reference
- Learn arguments and customization options
- Practice with common functions regularly
- Understand before memorizing function usage
