# Reproducibility

## Learning Objectives
- Explain why reproducibility matters in data science
- Identify key components of reproducible workflow
- Implement best practices for documentation
- Organize project files effectively

## Why Reproducibility Matters
- Cornerstone of scientific research and data analysis
- Ensures findings can be verified and methods understood
- Work can be built upon by others (including future self)
- Provides verification, collaboration, efficiency, impact, and trust

## Definition and Benefits
- Analysis can be recreated using same data and methods
- Others can confirm your findings
- Team members can understand and contribute
- You can revisit and build upon your own work

## Components of Reproducible Workflows
- Documented code with clear comments and structure
- Version control systems like Git for tracking changes
- Environment management for consistent software conditions
- Proper data management with preserved raw data

## Code Documentation Standards
- Clear purpose statements and input/output descriptions
- Parameter explanations and usage examples
- Error checking and validation within functions
- Comments explaining why, not just what code does

## Environment Management
- Document software environment for recreation
- Use sessionInfo() to capture package versions
- Consider renv package for project-specific environments
- Ensure others can recreate same conditions

## Data Management Principles
- Raw data preservation (never modify originals)
- Data cleaning scripts documenting all transformations
- Clear data documentation and metadata
- Transparent pipeline from raw to analysis-ready data

## File Organization Strategies
- Clear directory structure with logical separation
- Numbered scripts indicating workflow order
- Separate folders for data, code, results, documentation
- README files explaining project structure and usage

## Documentation Best Practices
- Comprehensive information including all necessary details
- Clear language avoiding jargon when possible
- Current documentation updated as project evolves
- Accessible storage with project files

## Project Structure Template
- README.md with project overview and instructions
- data/ folder with raw/ and processed/ subfolders
- code/ folder with numbered analysis scripts
- results/ folder for figures/ and tables/

## Version Control Integration
- Track changes to code and documentation over time
- Enable collaboration without file conflicts
- Ability to revert to previous versions if needed
- Essential component of modern reproducible research
