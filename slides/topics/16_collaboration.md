# Collaboration

## Learning Objectives
- Organize data science projects for effective collaboration
- Implement best practices for code sharing and documentation
- Use Git and GitHub for team-based workflows
- Maintain reproducibility in collaborative environments

## Why Collaborative Workflows Matter
- Data science increasingly a team effort
- Requires more than technical skills - thoughtful organization
- Increases productivity through division of labor
- Improves quality through peer review and diverse perspectives

## Key Collaboration Benefits
- Enhanced creativity through diverse perspectives
- Continuity when team members change
- Systematic approach maximizing productivity
- Maintained reproducibility and quality standards

## Project Organization for Teams
- Well-organized structure helps team navigation
- Separate folders for data, code, results, documentation
- README.md with overview and setup instructions
- CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors

## Essential Documentation Components
- Project overview with setup instructions and usage examples
- Code comments explaining why, not just what
- Function documentation with purpose, parameters, examples
- Data dictionary describing variables and sources

## Code Sharing Best Practices
- Follow consistent style guides (e.g., tidyverse style guide)
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout
- Format code for readability and understanding
- Consider linters and formatters for consistency

## Modular Code Development
- Break long scripts into functions
- Write code others can understand and reuse
- Clear function definitions with inputs and outputs
- Main workflow calling individual functions

## Package Management
- Ensure consistent package versions across team
- Use renv for project-specific package management
- Document package dependencies clearly
- Initialize and snapshot package environments

## Git Workflows for Teams
- Centralized workflow: simple approach for small teams
- Feature branch workflow: better for larger teams
- Forking workflow: common for open-source projects
- Choose appropriate workflow for team size and complexity

## Code Review Process
- Guidelines for reviewers: respectful, constructive, focus on code
- Guidelines for authors: explain changes, respond positively
- Keep pull requests focused and manageable
- Acknowledge good practices and thank reviewers

## Maintaining Reproducibility
- Environment management with renv or conda
- Document system requirements and dependencies
- Establish protocols for data access and sharing
- Implement continuous integration for automated testing
