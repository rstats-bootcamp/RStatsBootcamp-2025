# R Language

## Learning Objectives
- Navigate example scripts, comments, help, and pseudocode
- Use math operators effectively in R
- Apply logical Boolean operators for data manipulation
- Distinguish between base R and Tidyverse approaches

## R as a Passive-Aggressive Butler
- R is popular statistical programming language and open source software
- Designed to help non-programmers perform statistical analyses
- Sometimes requires careful language to avoid unexpected outcomes
- Essential to view scripts as documentation of work

## Script Organization Importance
- Write scripts as documentation for respected colleagues
- Work through instructions using R and RStudio actively
- Type your own code rather than copy-pasting
- Document all code with clear, concise comments

## Help System in R
- Use help() function with tool name in brackets
- Help pages organized consistently across all functions
- Function name, description, usage, and argument definitions
- Essential to understand for effective R use

## Math Operators
- Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /, ^ (power)
- Order of operations follows standard mathematical rules
- Use parentheses to control calculation order
- Spacing improves readability (use single spaces)

## Logical Boolean Operators
- Boolean expressions resolve to TRUE or FALSE
- Common operators: >, <, ==, !=, &, |, !
- Used for selecting groups of data effectively
- Powerful alternative to creating different datasets

## Selecting with Booleans
- Use Boolean expressions to select data subsets
- Square brackets act as index for data vectors
- Combine with logical operators for complex selections
- Essential skill for data manipulation

## Base R versus Tidyverse
- Base R: Traditional, powerful form of R language
- Tidyverse: Alternative approach with different conventions
- Both have benefits and philosophical differences
- Bootcamp focuses exclusively on base R first

## Script Section Requirements
- Header: Contains name, date, and purpose
- Contents: Roadmap listing all major sections
- Both sections essential for every R script
- Foundation for reproducible research practices

## Practice Exercises
- Working with Boolean expressions and operators
- Understanding help system navigation
- Writing expressions with proper spacing
- Creating and documenting script sections
