## Bootcamp resources

This material is intended to require a significant time commitment to complete (most students report about 20 hours at minimum). The schedule below is intended to be a concise overview of the different resources for the Bootcamp. Some pages have associated slides and videos linked here.

For all of the lab pages it is intended that you type and run 100% of the code in examples and then explicitly answer the exercise questions, which are based on examples for given code on the pages. Thus, to answer the questions it is recommended to adapt code you have already run when completing the pages.

We also a have a [friendly community Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ha-eda-party/shared_invite/zt-w19od3dz-6bjo~dTC_GQeSUUv3B8XzQ) - go over and introduce yourself and say hi!
