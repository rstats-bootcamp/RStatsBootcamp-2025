## R Stats Bootcamp

This is a website created to help people get started in statistical analysis and data science: to explore, visualize and analyze data, and to share and communicate results with others. The goal is to use a practical approach to scientific question formulation and evidence, through curating a range of high quality and open resources. The philosophy is practical with more emphasis on asking meaningful questions and statistical reasoning (and less on programming and engineering).
