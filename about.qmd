## Our Philosophy

We believe that data science should be: - **Accessible** to researchers at all levels - **Practical** with a focus on real-world applications - **Reproducible** to advance scientific integrity - **Collaborative** to encourage knowledge sharing
:::

## Who This Course Is For

This bootcamp is ideal for:

-   **Research students** beginning their data analysis journey
-   **Academic staff** looking to update their quantitative skills
-   **Professionals** transitioning to data-driven roles
-   **Self-learners** interested in R programming and statistics

No prior programming experience is requiredâ€”we'll guide you from the basics to more advanced concepts at a comfortable pace.

## What You'll Learn

### Module 1: R Foundations

Master the fundamentals of R programming and the RStudio environment. Learn to manipulate data, create functions, and work with different data structures.

### Module 2: Statistical Analysis

Apply your R skills to statistical analysis. Explore data visualization, hypothesis testing, correlation, regression, and more.

### Module 3: Reproducible Research
