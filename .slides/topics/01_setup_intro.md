# Setup & Introduction

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how the R Stats Bootcamp works
- Describe the motivation for using R
- Install R and RStudio or set up RStudio Cloud
- Navigate RStudio components and interface

## How the R Stats Bootcamp Works
- Provides practical, open instructional materials for learning R
- Reviews simple statistics in R
- Introduces reproducibility and collaboration tools
- Blend of practical material with videos and self-assessment

## R Motivation
- Designed for non-programmers to perform statistical analysis
- Growing popularity in universities, companies, and research
- Large community of users and high demand for R skills
- Free, open source, and cross-platform compatible

## Installation Options
- Option 1: Download R from CRAN and RStudio Desktop
- Option 2: Use RStudio Cloud for browser-based work
- Install R first, then RStudio for best results
- Consider your computer setup and preferences

## RStudio Interface Components
- Script window (upper left) for writing and executing code
- Console window (lower left) for output and messages
- Global Environment (upper right) for data objects
- Plots window (lower right) for graphics and help

## R Script Organization

- Interface between your commands and R software
- Should be clear for future collaborators
- Think of future self as respected colleague

## Script Structure Best Practices
- Header with name, date, and purpose
- Contents section as roadmap for analysis
- Code chunks with descriptive titles
- Consistent numbering and logical organization

## Code Execution Methods
- Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Return on Mac) for current line
- Select code and Ctrl+Enter for specific sections
- Use Run button in Script window
- Access through Code menu for additional options

## Comments and Documentation
- Use # character for comment lines
- Explain code like methods section of scientific paper
- Provide enough detail for exact replication
- Balance thoroughness with conciseness

## Practice Exercises
- Download and examine sample scripts
- Practice running code and examining output
- Add code chunks with proper comments
- Create variables and calculate basic statistics
